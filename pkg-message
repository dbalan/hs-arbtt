This port does not start artbtt-capture automatically, you need to setup your desktop enviroment to run arbtt-capture on start.

On supported WMs such as GNOME, KDE you can do that by
cp ${PREFIX}/share/examples/arbtt/arbtt-capture.desktop ~/.config/autostart/

Also, you would need to have a categorize file at ~/.arbtt/categorize.cfg to run arbtt-stats
A sample file is installed at ${PREFIX}/share/examples/arbtt/categorize.cfg
